COLUMN-ORIENTED DATABASE

### Description

Traditional relational databases are row-oriented, with each row having a row-id and each field within the row stored together in a table. 
Every time you look something up in a row-oriented database, every row is scanned, regardless of which columns you require. 

SEARCH DATABASE

### Description

The primary aim of the search is to retrieve the most relevant matches to the userâ€™s queries, excluding other general content from the website.
The system should be able to narrow down the search by using ranges (price, dates, sizes, etc.), sorting (by popularity, date, price) and filtering (including only desirable parameters). When we talk about web apps where information changes dynamically (prices, description details, availability of goods), it is extremely important to have near real-time updates; for example, in eCommerce or booking engines to show goods and services available in stock, engines can provide recommendations when looking up for the most interesting products or information, to improve the user experience.

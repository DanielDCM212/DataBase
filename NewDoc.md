## COLUMN-ORIENTED DATABASE

### Description

Traditional relational databases are row-oriented, with each row having a row-id and each field within the row stored together in a table. 
Every time you look something up in a row-oriented database, every row is scanned, regardless of which columns you require. 


#### Performance

Columnar systems generally outperform relationship systems in almost all circumstances, but the range can vary widely. Queries that include calculations or individual access to records can be as slow or slower than a properly indexed relational system.

#### Structural limitations
Columnar databases use different techniques to imitate a relational structure. Some require the same main key in all tables, that is, the database hierarchy is limited to two levels. 



#### Benefits
> + High performance on aggregation queries (like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)  
> + Highly efficient data compression and/or partitioning  
> + True scalability and fast data loading for Big Data  
> + Accessible by many 3rd party BI analytic tools  
> + Fairly simple systems administration

#### Advantages for certain types of systems
> + Data Warehouses and Business Intelligence  
> + Customer Relationship Management (CRM)  
> + Library Card Catalogs  
> + Ad hoc query systems

#### Disadvantages
> + Transactions are to be avoided or just not supported
> + Queries with table joins can reduce high performance 
> + Record updates and deletes reduce storage efficiency 
> + Effective partitioning/indexing schemes can be difficult to design

| Performance    	| Cassandra consistently outperforms popular NoSQL alternatives in benchmarks and real applications,<br>primarily because of fundamental architectural choices.                                                                                                                                                	| In any production environment, HBase is running with a cluster of more than 5000 nodes, only Hmaster acts as the master to all the slaves Region servers.<br>If Hmaster goes down, it can be only be recovered after a long time.<br>Even though the client is able to connect region server. Having another master is possible but only one will be active.<br>It will take a long time to activate the second Hmaster if the main Hmaster goes down. So, Hmaster is a performance bottleneck. 	| ClickHouse uses all available hardware to its full potential to process each query as fast as possible.<br>Peak processing performance for a single query stands at more than 2 terabytes per second (after decompression, only used columns).<br>In distributed setup reads are automatically balanced among healthy replicas to avoid increasing latency. 	|

## Description

A time series database (TSDB) is a database optimized for time-stamped or time series data. Time series data are simply measurements or events that are tracked, monitored, down sampled, and aggregated over time. This could be server metrics, application performance monitoring, network data, sensor data, events, clicks, trades in a market, and many other types of analytics data.

## Performance

A time series database is built specifically for handling metrics and events or measurements that are time stamped. A TSDB is optimized for measuring change over time. Properties that make time series data very different than other data workloads are data lifecycle management, summarization, and large range scans of many records.

## Advantages

- Scalability

- It balance the ACID/BASE relationship by offering principles that suit time series data.

- Usability

- Trade-offs: Database architecture is about trade-offs and priorities.

## Data features:

- Data is appended in sequence.

- Data can be multi-dimensional correlated.

- Hot data is typically accessed at high frequencies.

- Cold data needs to be reduced in dimension and archived.

- Data mainly covers values, states, and events.

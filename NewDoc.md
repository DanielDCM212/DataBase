## COLUMN-ORIENTED DATABASE

### Description

Traditional relational databases are row-oriented, with each row having a row-id and each field within the row stored together in a table. 
Every time you look something up in a row-oriented database, every row is scanned, regardless of which columns you require. 

#### Benefits
> + High performance on aggregation queries (like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)  
> + Highly efficient data compression and/or partitioning  
> + True scalability and fast data loading for Big Data  
> + Accessible by many 3rd party BI analytic tools  
> + Fairly simple systems administration

#### Advantages for certain types of systems
> + Data Warehouses and Business Intelligence  
> + Customer Relationship Management (CRM)  
> + Library Card Catalogs  
> + Ad hoc query systems

#### Disadvantages
> + Transactions are to be avoided or just not supported
> + Queries with table joins can reduce high performance 
> + Record updates and deletes reduce storage efficiency 
> + Effective partitioning/indexing schemes can be difficult to design

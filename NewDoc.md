## COLUMN-ORIENTED DATABASE

### Description

Traditional relational databases are row-oriented, with each row having a row-id and each field within the row stored together in a table. 
Every time you look something up in a row-oriented database, every row is scanned, regardless of which columns you require. 


#### Performance

Columnar systems generally outperform relationship systems in almost all circumstances, but the range can vary widely. Queries that include calculations or individual access to records can be as slow or slower than a properly indexed relational system.

#### Structural limitations
Columnar databases use different techniques to imitate a relational structure. Some require the same main key in all tables, that is, the database hierarchy is limited to two levels. 



#### Benefits
> + High performance on aggregation queries (like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)  
> + Highly efficient data compression and/or partitioning  
> + True scalability and fast data loading for Big Data  
> + Accessible by many 3rd party BI analytic tools  
> + Fairly simple systems administration

#### Advantages for certain types of systems
> + Data Warehouses and Business Intelligence  
> + Customer Relationship Management (CRM)  
> + Library Card Catalogs  
> + Ad hoc query systems

#### Disadvantages
> + Transactions are to be avoided or just not supported
> + Queries with table joins can reduce high performance 
> + Record updates and deletes reduce storage efficiency 
> + Effective partitioning/indexing schemes can be difficult to design

## Time-series data

### Description

A time series database (TSDB) is a database optimized for time-stamped or time series data. Time series data are simply measurements or events that are tracked, monitored, down sampled, and aggregated over time. This could be server metrics, application performance monitoring, network data, sensor data, events, clicks, trades in a market, and many other types of analytics data.

#### Performance

A time series database is built specifically for handling metrics and events or measurements that are time stamped. A TSDB is optimized for measuring change over time. Properties that make time series data very different than other data workloads are data lifecycle management, summarization, and large range scans of many records.

#### Advantages

- Scalability
- It balance the ACID/BASE relationship by offering principles that suit time series data.
- Usability
- Trade-offs: Database architecture is about trade-offs and priorities.

#### Data features:

- Data is appended in sequence.
- Data can be multi-dimensional correlated.
- Hot data is typically accessed at high frequencies.
- Cold data needs to be reduced in dimension and archived.
- Data mainly covers values, states, and events.

## SEARCH DATABASE

### Description

The primary aim of the search is to retrieve the most relevant matches to the userâs queries, excluding other general content from the website.
The system should be able to narrow down the search by using ranges (price, dates, sizes, etc.), sorting (by popularity, date, price) and filtering (including only desirable parameters). When we talk about web apps where information changes dynamically (prices, description details, availability of goods), it is extremely important to have near real-time updates; for example, in eCommerce or booking engines to show goods and services available in stock, engines can provide recommendations when looking up for the most interesting products or information, to improve the user experience.

#### Performance

When the database grows, it becomes more difficult to look up. Search Database scales up while your DB gets bigger, so the search speed does not slow down, can be used not only as an indexer, but also as a data storage. Nevertheless, we would not recommend using it as your primary storage, and we still keep data in the main DB for better security and reliability, using Search Engines only to index data and store logs

#### Structural Limitations 

Multi get and multi term vectors API throw IndexNotFoundException when trying to access non existing indices that the user is not authorized for. By doing that they leak information regarding the fact that the index doesnât exist, while the user is not authorized to know anything about those indices.

#### Benefits

 * full-text search (by simple words and phrases or multiple forms of a word or phrase)
 * Multifield search
 * Highlighting (visual indicator of the searched words)
 * Search by synonyms
 * Autocomplete suggestions
 * faceted search (opperations of counting)
 * fuzzy search(algorithms such as levestain algorithm, to detect typos or misspellings)
 * geospacial search(an object such as location according to its latitude an longitude)

#### Advantages

 1. Near real-time
 2. High scalability
 3. Not only indexer but used as a database
 4. Visualization of the Data
 5. Machine Learning for anomaly detection and outlier detection 
 6. Fast search 

#### Disadvantages

* The configuration of the system is not very intuitive
* Many updates in the database might affect the retrival of results
* It is needed to review the date converge, many problem matching for recen databases

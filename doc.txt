COLUMN-ORIENTED DATABASE

Traditional relational databases are row-oriented, with each row having a row-id and each field within the row stored together in a table. Let’s say, for example’s  sake, that no extra data about hobbies is stored and you have only a single table to  describe people, as shown in figure 6.8. Notice how in this scenario you have slight denormalization because hobbies could be repeated. If the hobby information is a nice extra but not essential to your use case, adding it as a list within the Hobbies column is an acceptable approach. But if the information isn’t important enough for a separate table, should it be stored at all?

Every time you look something up in a row-oriented database, every row is scanned, regardless of which columns you require. Let’s say you only want a list of birthdays in September. The database will scan the table from top to bottom and left to right, as shown in figure 3, eventually returning the list of birthdays.
